    "#### 5.1 Identify the Vertical Direction\n",
    "Initially, we set the y axis along the direction of the lance, but the performance of the model is not really good. By observing the data we have, we found that the accelarations along the y and z axises are quite similar, while the accelarations along the x axis are much larger. And we also did some research, it saies that the accelaration is usually greater than those one other two directions cause the existence of gravity. So we think the x axis may be the vertical direction, and our following work is based on this assumption.\n",
    "#### 5.2 Axis Scaling\n",
    "The lance would move back and forth given a fixed pointed. The accelarations along y and z axises would change if we change the position of the sensor. And after analyzing, we think that the accelarations along y and z axises would increase/decrease with some common factor by changing the position of the sensor. By scaling the the accelarations along the y and z axises, we think this can minimize the influence of different sensor positions.\n",
    "#### 5.3 Axis Rotation\n",
    "When we worked on this task, we found that even if the sensors are in the same position of the lance, which means the distances between them and the fixed point are the same, the accelarations along y and z axises can be different if we rotate the sensors with some angle. But the accelaration on the vertical direction remanis unchanged. The solution we came up with is adding some noise into the training set. For each item in the training set, we rotate the axises of y and z with mathematical method. This can prevent the model from overfitting the training data."

    "In different groups of experiments, the directions of the y and z axises can be different, depending on how to install the sensors. When processing the training data, we rotate the y, z axises with the angle from 1 to 359. This way, we can introduce some noise into the data set. Besides, we get a much larger training set because we add a lot of new data items.\n",

    "\n",
    "The picture above illustrates the relationship between the accelarations along the y, z axises and the distance between the sensors and the fixed point. As long as the sensors are installed on the same lance, they should have the same angular velocities, and that's the idea behind scaling the axises. Scaling the axises is just like moving the sensor to different position. By scaling the axises, we hope to minimize the influence made by moving the sensors.\n",

    "The reason we rotate the axis is adding some noise into the data set, and it helps to prevent from overfitting and to build large dataset. However, in the previous experiments, the sensors are installed without rotation, which means, overfitting may give better results on even testing data. To see if rotate the axises could really improve the performance of the model on more general data set, we did another test.\n",

    "\n",
    "Testing the model on the new data set, we can see that the performance is improved significantly. Because the sensor in trail 4i is rotated with 90 degree. By rotating the axises, we can make the model more generalize.\n",
